## Getting Started

### NPM

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

```
npm install [INSERT NAME OF TEAM 11 PACKAGE]
```

<!-- TODO - Git instructions? -->

### Prerequisites

<!-- TODO - Put testcafe and stuff like that -->

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

<!-- NPM takes care of these stuff so not sure what to put here, maybe unnecessary -->

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
