        Hello Peter! I close in 4.5 seconds

        This is supposed to be a longer message so that the height expands a bit more.
    </beer-notification-lit>
 
    <beer-notification-lit type="danger" title="Danger" duration="0">
        Making this message a lot longer than the others to see if notifications are positioned
        well relative to eachother even if they are all different sizes. If you
        were to close this notification, the notifications below me will shift up!
        How great is that?
